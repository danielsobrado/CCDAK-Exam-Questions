## Question 2:
When needing to aggregate real-time data from a Kafka topic, compute running totals, and then publish those totals back to another Kafka topic for further analysis, which tool should you use?

1. Consumer + Producer
2. Kafka Connect Source
3. Kafka Connect Sink
4. Kafka Streams

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

The correct answer is **4. Kafka Streams.**

**Explanation:**

## Question 4:
A financial institution wants to analyze transaction data in real-time to detect fraudulent activities. The transaction data, which includes sensitive information, is initially stored in a mainframe system. Which approach ensures secure, real-time analysis of this data by a Kafka Streams application while complying with data privacy regulations?

1. Utilize a mainframe connector with Kafka Connect to ingest the transaction data into a Kafka topic. Apply a Kafka Streams application to anonymize sensitive information in the stream before conducting fraud analysis.
2.  Directly connect the mainframe system to the Kafka Streams application using a custom API, ensuring sensitive data is filtered out during the streaming process.
3.  Employ ksqlDB to directly query the mainframe system, apply data anonymization functions to filter out sensitive information, and then write the sanitized data to a Kafka topic for stream processing.
4.  Implement a batch process to extract transaction data periodically from the mainframe, cleanse the data of sensitive information, and then load the sanitized data into Kafka topics for streaming analysis.

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

The correct answer is **1. Utilize a mainframe connector with Kafka Connect to ingest the transaction data into a Kafka topic. Apply a Kafka Streams application to anonymize sensitive information in the stream before conducting fraud analysis.**

## Question 5:
Your organization aims to implement a real-time recommendation engine for e-commerce users based on their browsing behavior. User session data is considered sensitive and must be anonymized before processing. How can the Kafka ecosystem be leveraged to meet these requirements?

1. Deploy a Kafka Connect Source Connector to capture session data directly into Kafka, using Stream Processing to anonymize user identifiers before aggregating sessions for recommendation analysis.
2.  Use a custom Kafka Producer application to publish session data to a topic, applying a Stream Processor to anonymize and then process the data for generating recommendations.
3.  Implement a Kafka Connect Sink Connector to store session data into a NoSQL database, with a pre-processor to remove sensitive information before ingestion. Use Kafka Streams to read from the database for analysis.
4.  Create a ksqlDB process to pull session data from source systems, apply anonymization functions within ksqlDB, and output the clean data to a Kafka topic for further processing by the Kafka Streams application.

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

The correct answer is **1. Deploy a Kafka Connect Source Connector to capture session data directly into Kafka, using Stream Processing to anonymize user identifiers before aggregating sessions for recommendation analysis.**

## Question 6:
An organization is implementing a system to monitor and alert on infrastructure health status in real-time. The system collects metrics from various sources, including some that contain proprietary information. Which approach ensures that only non-proprietary, critical health metrics are analyzed and alerted on?

1. Use Kafka Connect with appropriate Source Connectors for each metric source, configuring the connectors to filter out proprietary information. Process the filtered metrics stream with Kafka Streams for alerting.
2.  Directly stream all metrics into Kafka using custom Producers, then employ a Kafka Streams application to separate proprietary data from non-proprietary data, and analyze the latter for alerting.
3.  Implement a series of ksqlDB statements to ingest metrics into Kafka, applying filtering logic within ksqlDB to remove proprietary information before streaming processing and alerting.
4.  Configure a Kafka Connect Sink Connector to aggregate all metrics into a centralized database, followed by batch processing to remove proprietary information before streaming the data into Kafka for real-time analysis.

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

The correct answer is **1. Use Kafka Connect with appropriate Source Connectors for each metric source, configuring the connectors to filter out proprietary information. Process the filtered metrics stream with Kafka Streams for alerting.**

## Question 7:
A multinational corporation is looking to aggregate sales data from multiple regional systems into a centralized Kafka topic for real-time analysis and reporting. The regional systems vary in technology, including SQL databases and cloud-based storage solutions. Which solution enables the efficient and unified ingestion of these diverse data sources into Kafka?

1. Deploy Kafka Streams applications near each regional system to collect and forward data to the centralized Kafka topic.
2.  Use Kafka Connect with a mix of Source Connectors suitable for each regional system's technology to ingest data directly into Kafka.
3.  Implement custom Kafka Producers embedded within each regional system to push data to the centralized Kafka topic.
