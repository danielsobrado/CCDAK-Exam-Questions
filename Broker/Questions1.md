## Question 1:
Assuming a Kafka topic is configured with the following settings:
- `log.segment.bytes` = 1073741824 (1GB)
- `log.retention.ms` = 86400000 (1 day)
- `log.retention.bytes` = -1

Which of the following statements accurately describes the log retention policy for this Kafka topic?

1. Logs are retained based on size; once the log size exceeds 1GB, older segments are deleted.
2. Logs are retained for exactly one day, regardless of the size of the log.
3. Logs are retained until the size of the log exceeds 1GB or for one day, whichever comes first.
4. Logs are retained indefinitely, as `log.retention.bytes` is set to -1, overriding other retention configurations.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **2. Logs are retained for exactly one day, regardless of the size of the log.**

Explanation:

1. **Incorrect**. Although `log.segment.bytes` is set to 1GB, this setting alone does not dictate log retention based on size. It specifies the maximum size of a single log segment file. The deletion policy based on size is controlled by `log.retention.bytes`, which is not effectively set here due to its value being -1 (indicating no limit).

2. **Correct**. The setting `log.retention.ms` = 86400000 specifies that logs are retained for 86400000 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 24 hours or one day. This means logs are deleted after one day, regardless of their size, as long as `log.retention.bytes` does not impose a stricter limit, which in this case, it does not (`log.retention.bytes` = -1).

3. **Incorrect**. This statement misinterprets the settings. Kafka does not use both `log.retention.ms` and `log.retention.bytes` to determine a "whichever comes first" policy. Instead, both conditions must be met for a log segment to be eligible for deletion. Given `log.retention.bytes` = -1, size-based deletion is effectively disabled, leaving time-based deletion as the operative policy. 

4. **Incorrect**. The statement that logs are retained indefinitely is wrong because `log.retention.ms` is explicitly set to a finite duration (86400000 ms or 1 day), dictating a time-based retention policy. The `-1` value for `log.retention.bytes` means there is no size limit on log retention, but it does not affect or override the time-based retention set by `log.retention.ms`.

## Question 2:
Consider a Kafka topic with the following configuration:
- `cleanup.policy` = "compact,delete"
- `min.cleanable.dirty.ratio` = 0.5
- `delete.retention.ms` = 86400000 (1 day)
- `segment.ms` = 43200000 (12 hours)

Which of the following statements correctly describes the behavior of log compaction and deletion for this topic?

1. Log compaction and deletion are mutually exclusive; only one policy can be active at any time.
2. Log compaction will occur once 50% of the segment data is marked as dirty, and logs older than 1 day will be deleted.
3. Deleted records are removed immediately from the log; `delete.retention.ms` specifies the retention time for all records.
4. `segment.ms` dictates the maximum lifespan of any record in the log, after which it is eligible for compaction or deletion.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **2. Log compaction will occur once 50% of the segment data is marked as dirty, and logs older than 1 day will be deleted.**

Explanation:

1. **Incorrect**. The configuration `cleanup.policy` = "compact,delete" allows for both log compaction and deletion policies to be applied to the same topic. This means that the log will undergo compaction to remove duplicates and retain only the latest value for each key, and log segments can also be deleted based on time or size constraints.

2. **Correct**. With `min.cleanable.dirty.ratio` set to 0.5, log compaction is triggered when at least 50% of the segment is considered dirty, which means it contains records that are either duplicates or marked for deletion. The `delete.retention.ms` setting ensures that a record marked for deletion remains in the log for an additional day after being deleted, which allows for consumer recovery in case of deletion mistakes before the log is compacted.

3. **Incorrect**. Deleted records are not removed immediately; instead, they are marked for deletion and actually removed during the next compaction cycle. The `delete.retention.ms` parameter specifies the time a deleted record is retained before being permanently removed from the log as part of compaction, not the retention time for all records.

4. **Incorrect**. `segment.ms` specifies the time after which Kafka will close the current log segment and create a new one. It does not dictate the maximum lifespan of any record in the log. Record lifespan is determined by the `cleanup.policy` and associated configurations like `log.retention.ms` for deletion and `min.cleanable.dirty.ratio` for compaction.

## Question 3:
In a Kafka cluster, the Controller is a critical component for managing cluster state. Which of the following statements accurately describe the role and election of the Controller? (Select two)

1. Elected by broker majority.
2. Elected by Zookeeper ensemble.
3. Responsible for partition leader election.
4. Manages consumer group offsets.
5. Automatically assigns replicas to brokers based on load.

Choose the correct answers.

### Response:
The correct answers are **2. Elected by Zookeeper ensemble.** and **3. Responsible for partition leader election.**

### Explanation:

1. **Incorrect**. The Controller in a Kafka cluster is not elected by a broker majority. The election process is not based on a majority vote among the brokers themselves.

2. **Correct**. The Controller is elected by the Zookeeper ensemble. Kafka uses Zookeeper to manage cluster metadata and to perform leader election for the controller. When the current Controller fails or loses connection to Zookeeper, a new Controller is elected by Zookeeper from among the live members of the cluster.

3. **Correct**. One of the primary responsibilities of the Controller is to manage partition leader elections. When a partition leader fails, the Controller is responsible for choosing a new leader from the set of in-sync replicas (ISRs) and updating the cluster metadata accordingly.

4. **Incorrect**. Managing consumer group offsets is not a responsibility of the Controller. Consumer group offsets are maintained by Kafka brokers, with the offsets being stored either in a dedicated __consumer_offsets topic within Kafka (for newer versions) or Zookeeper (for older versions).

5. **Incorrect**. Automatically assigning replicas to brokers based on load is not directly managed by the Controller. Replica assignment is typically done at topic creation time or during manual rebalancing operations. While the Controller does manage some aspects of replica management, such as initiating reassignment tasks, the automatic balancing of load is not a direct responsibility of the Controller but can be achieved through tools like Kafka's built-in partition reassignment tool or third-party solutions.

Note: While this answer describes the traditional Kafka deployment using Zookeeper, newer versions of Kafka (with KIP-500/KRaft) can operate without Zookeeper, using a different controller election mechanism.

## Question 4:
In the context of Kafka's distributed architecture, broker elections are vital for cluster health and stability. Consider the following advanced scenarios where Kafka's internal mechanisms must decide on leadership roles:

1. If a broker acting as the Controller goes down, what mechanism is responsible for the election of a new Controller?
2. A partition leader fails, and all its replicas are on brokers with the same network latency to the Zookeeper ensemble. How is the new leader chosen among the replicas?
3. During a network partition, a subset of brokers becomes isolated from the main cluster. What determines which brokers will continue to serve as leaders for their partitions?

Select the most accurate answers for each scenario:

- A. The Zookeeper ensemble elects the new Controller based on ephemeral node creation sequence.
- B. The new partition leader is elected based on the ISR list order, favoring replicas with the most recent updates.
- C. Brokers in the main cluster segment with access to Zookeeper retain their roles, while isolated brokers step down until connectivity is restored.
- D. A broker majority within the isolated segment elects a new temporary Controller until the network partition is resolved.
- E. The election of a new partition leader among replicas with identical network latency is determined by a random selection process.

Choose the correct answers.

Response:

1. **- A. The Zookeeper ensemble elects the new Controller based on ephemeral node creation sequence.**
   
   Explanation: When the broker acting as the Controller fails, Zookeeper plays a crucial role in the election of a new Controller. Kafka brokers register themselves with Zookeeper using ephemeral nodes. When the current Controller's node disappears from Zookeeper (due to failure or disconnection), Zookeeper triggers the Controller re-election process among the live brokers. The new Controller is typically the first broker to respond to this trigger, based on the sequence of ephemeral node creation.

2. **B. The new partition leader is elected based on the ISR list order, favoring replicas with the most recent updates.**
   
   Explanation: Kafka does not use a random process or explicit network latency measurements to select a new leader among replicas. Instead, it relies on the ordered list of in-sync replicas (ISRs) for each partition. The new leader is usually the first replica in the ISR list that is still available. This mechanism ensures that the chosen leader is up-to-date with the latest messages to prevent data loss.

3. **C. Brokers in the main cluster segment with access to Zookeeper retain their roles, while isolated brokers step down until connectivity is restored.**
   
   Explanation: In the event of a network partition that isolates a subset of brokers, the decision on which brokers continue to serve as leaders for their partitions depends on their ability to communicate with Zookeeper. Brokers on the side of the partition that maintains connectivity to Zookeeper continue to function normally, retaining their roles. Meanwhile, isolated brokers lose their leadership status for partitions and step down, becoming followers if they are part of the ISR and can establish leadership once connectivity is restored and they rejoin the cluster. This ensures the cluster remains operational and consistent, prioritizing segments with Zookeeper connectivity.

D and E are incorrect options based on Kafka's current architecture and leader election protocols.

## Question 5:
A Kafka producer is configured to use the `acks=all` setting while publishing messages to a topic partition that has a replication factor of 3. The topic is also configured with `min.insync.replicas=2`. Broker A hosts the current leader for this partition, while Brokers B and C host the replicas. Due to unforeseen circumstances, both Broker B and Broker C go offline simultaneously.

1. The producer will be able to publish messages, but with potential data loss.
2. The producer will temporarily be unable to publish messages until at least one replica broker comes back online.
3. The producer will continue to publish messages successfully without any impact.
4. The producer will immediately switch to another topic's partition that has all replicas available.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **2. The producer will temporarily be unable to publish messages until at least one replica broker comes back online.**

Explanation:

1. **Incorrect**. With `acks=all`, the producer requires acknowledgments from the leader and all in-sync replicas (ISRs) to consider a message write successful. If Brokers B and C are offline, it's not a matter of potential data loss but rather that the producer cannot achieve the required acknowledgments from all replicas, as they are not available to replicate the data.

2. **Correct**. The `acks=all` setting ensures that the producer receives acknowledgments from the partition leader and all replicas before considering a message successfully published. If Brokers B and C, hosting the replicas, go offline, the condition for `acks=all` cannot be met because these replicas cannot acknowledge the message replication. As a result, the producer will be unable to publish new messages to this partition until at least one of the replicas (Broker B or C) becomes available again and can acknowledge the message replication alongside the leader (Broker A). If Brokers B and C were considered part of the ISR list before going down, the producer would be unable to publish messages because it expects acknowledgments from all ISRs, which now includes unavailable brokers. This state creates a temporary inability to publish new messages, as the producer cannot satisfy its acknowledgment requirements. However, the immediate effect of brokers going offline is that they are removed from the ISR for that partition. If the leader (Broker A) remains online but all replicas are offline, the ISR shrinks to include only the leader. In real-time operation, Kafka aims to maintain availability and durability, so the producer can still publish messages, but only if at least one replica comes back online to fulfill the acks=all requirement of replicating to all in-sync replicas. This detail was overlooked in the initial explanation. The immediate effect of the replica brokers going offline is that they are removed from the in-sync replica (ISR) list for the partition. Note that if the leader (Broker A) remains online, the producer can still publish messages to the partition, but the `acks=all` requirement ensures that the messages are replicated to all available ISRs before being considered successfully published. So, the producer's ability to publish depends on the presence of at least one ISR, which in this case would be just the leader until a replica comes back online.

3. **Incorrect**. The `acks=all` configuration means that the producer expects acknowledgments from all replicas to ensure data durability. If the replicas are down, the producer won't be able to receive acknowledgments from all required parties, impacting its ability to successfully publish messages. It's not about continuing without impact; the producer will face a temporary blockade in publishing messages.  Kafka aims to maintain a balance between availability and durability. While the `acks=all` setting prioritizes durability, Kafka's design allows for continued operation with a reduced ISR to maintain availability, as long as the minimum ISR count is met.

4. **Incorrect**. Kafka producers do not automatically switch to another topic's partition in response to issues with the current partition's replicas. The producer's target partition is determined by the partitioning logic (either default or custom) at the time of message production. Failures of replicas in a partition do not trigger automatic redirection of messages to different partitions within the same or different topics.

## Question 6:
When a Kafka broker starts up, it performs various initialization tasks. Which of the following is NOT one of these tasks?

1. Registering itself with Zookeeper.
2. Loading the replica assignment for each partition it hosts.
3. Creating a new Zookeeper znode for each topic it has partitions for.
4. Initializing the log directories for each partition it hosts.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **3. Creating a new Zookeeper znode for each topic it has partitions for.**

Explanation:

1. **Incorrect**. When a Kafka broker starts up, one of the first tasks it performs is registering itself with Zookeeper. It creates an ephemeral znode under the `/brokers/ids` path in Zookeeper, which signifies its presence in the cluster.

2. **Incorrect**. The broker loads the replica assignment for each partition it hosts from Zookeeper during startup. This information is stored in Zookeeper under the `/brokers/topics` path and contains the mapping of partitions to their assigned replicas.

3. **Correct**. A Kafka broker does not create new Zookeeper znodes for each topic it has partitions for during startup. The topic znodes are created when the topics themselves are created, either through the Kafka admin tools or via the Kafka broker when it receives a request to create a new topic.

4. **Incorrect**. Initializing the log directories for each partition it hosts is an essential task performed by the broker during startup. It ensures that the necessary directory structure and files are in place for storing and managing the partition data.

## Question 7:
In a Kafka cluster, the Controller is responsible for managing partition states and leadership. How does the Controller ensure that partition leadership is evenly distributed among the brokers in the cluster?

1. The Controller periodically triggers a rebalance operation to redistribute partition leadership.
2. The Controller assigns leadership to the broker with the least number of leader partitions for each new partition.
3. The Controller uses a round-robin algorithm to assign leadership across brokers.
4. The Controller does not actively manage the distribution of partition leadership among brokers.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **4. The Controller does not actively manage the distribution of partition leadership among brokers.**

Explanation:

1. **Incorrect**. The Controller does not periodically trigger rebalance operations to redistribute partition leadership. Rebalancing is typically initiated by Kafka administrators or automated tools based on cluster performance and resource utilization.

2. **Incorrect**. The Controller does not assign leadership based on the number of leader partitions each broker currently has. When a partition leader needs to be elected, the Controller selects the first replica in the ISR (in-sync replica) list, regardless of the broker's current leadership count.

3. **Incorrect**. The Controller does not use a round-robin algorithm to assign leadership across brokers. The leader election process is based on the ISR list and the availability of replicas, rather than a predetermined order or rotation.

4. **Correct**. The Controller's primary responsibility is to manage partition states and elect partition leaders when necessary, such as when a broker fails or a new partition is created. However, it does not actively aim to evenly distribute partition leadership among brokers. The distribution of partition leadership is a result of factors like topic creation, replica assignment, and broker failures, rather than being actively managed by the Controller.

## Question 8:
Consider a Kafka cluster with 5 brokers and a topic with 10 partitions and a replication factor of 3. The cluster experiences a network partition, splitting the brokers into two groups: Group A with 2 brokers and Group B with 3 brokers. Both groups can communicate with Zookeeper. How does Kafka handle partition leadership in this scenario?

1. Partitions with a leader in Group A will continue to function normally, while partitions with a leader in Group B will be offline until the network partition is resolved.
2. Partitions with a leader in Group B will continue to function normally, while partitions with a leader in Group A will elect new leaders from the ISRs in Group B.
3. All partitions will be offline until the network partition is resolved, as the brokers cannot reach a quorum for leader election.
4. The behavior is non-deterministic and depends on which group the Controller belongs to.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **2. Partitions with a leader in Group B will continue to function normally, while partitions with a leader in Group A will elect new leaders from the ISRs in Group B.**

Explanation:

1. **Incorrect**. In a network partition scenario where both groups can communicate with Zookeeper, Kafka prioritizes availability and allows the larger group (Group B in this case) to continue operating normally. Partitions with a leader in Group A will not continue to function normally, as they do not have a majority of ISRs available.

2. **Correct**. Kafka's partition leadership election process is designed to ensure that the cluster remains available and functional in the presence of network partitions. When a network partition occurs, Kafka follows the "majority rule" to determine which group of brokers should remain active. In this scenario, Group B has a majority of brokers (3 out of 5) and can communicate with Zookeeper. Therefore, partitions with a leader in Group B will continue to function normally. For partitions with a leader in Group A, the brokers in Group B will detect the loss of the leader and elect a new leader from the available ISRs within Group - B. This ensures that all partitions have a functioning leader and can continue to serve client requests.

3. **Incorrect**. Not all partitions will be offline in this scenario. As long as a group of brokers (in this case, Group B) has a majority and can communicate with Zookeeper, Kafka will allow that group to continue operating and serving client requests for the partitions they hold the leadership for.

4. **Incorrect**. The behavior of partition leadership in a network partition scenario is deterministic and does not depend on which group the Controller belongs to. Kafka's partition leadership election process is designed to prioritize availability and maintain consistency based on the majority of brokers and their ability to communicate with Zookeeper, regardless of the Controller's location.

## Question 9:
In a Kafka cluster, a broker is configured with the following settings:
- `num.io.threads=8`
- `num.network.threads=4`
- `num.replica.fetchers=2`

What do these configurations control in terms of the broker's performance and resource utilization?

1. `num.io.threads` controls the number of threads used for disk I/O operations, `num.network.threads` controls the number of threads used for network I/O operations, and `num.replica.fetchers` controls the number of threads used for fetching messages from the leader replica.

2. `num.io.threads` controls the number of threads used for network I/O operations, `num.network.threads` controls the number of threads used for disk I/O operations, and `num.replica.fetchers` controls the number of threads used for fetching messages from the leader replica.

3. `num.io.threads` controls the number of threads used for disk I/O operations, `num.network.threads` controls the number of threads used for network I/O operations, and `num.replica.fetchers` controls the number of threads used for replicating messages to follower replicas.

4. `num.io.threads` controls the number of threads used for replicating messages to follower replicas, `num.network.threads` controls the number of threads used for disk I/O operations, and `num.replica.fetchers` controls the number of threads used for network I/O operations.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **1. `num.io.threads` controls the number of threads used for disk I/O operations, `num.network.threads` controls the number of threads used for network I/O operations, and `num.replica.fetchers` controls the number of threads used for fetching messages from the leader replica.**

Explanation:

1. **Correct**. The given configurations control different aspects of the broker's performance and resource utilization:
   - `num.io.threads` specifies the number of I/O threads the broker uses for disk I/O operations, such as reading and writing message data to disk.
   - `num.network.threads` specifies the number of network threads the broker uses for handling network I/O operations, such as accepting client connections and processing requests.
   - `num.replica.fetchers` specifies the number of threads used by the broker to fetch messages from the leader replica for partitions it is a follower for. These threads are responsible for replicating data from the leader to the follower replicas.

2. **Incorrect**. The description of `num.io.threads` and `num.network.threads` is swapped in this option. `num.io.threads` is used for disk I/O operations, while `num.network.threads` is used for network I/O operations.

3. **Incorrect**. The description of `num.replica.fetchers` is incorrect in this option. `num.replica.fetchers` controls the number of threads used for fetching messages from the leader replica, not for replicating messages to follower replicas.

4. **Incorrect**. The descriptions of all three configurations are incorrect in this option. `num.io.threads` is used for disk I/O operations, `num.network.threads` is used for network I/O operations, and `num.replica.fetchers` is used for fetching messages from the leader replica.

## Question 10:
A Kafka broker is configured with the following settings:
- `log.segment.bytes=1073741824`
- `log.segment.ms=86400000`
- `log.retention.bytes=-1`
- `log.retention.ms=604800000`

Based on these configurations, when will Kafka start a new log segment for a partition, and how long will the old log segments be retained?

1. Kafka will start a new log segment when the current segment reaches 1 GB in size or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. Old log segments will be retained for 7 days.

2. Kafka will start a new log segment when the current segment reaches 1 GB in size or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. Old log segments will be retained indefinitely.

3. Kafka will start a new log segment when the current segment reaches 1 GB in size. Old log segments will be retained for 7 days or until the total log size exceeds 1 GB, whichever comes first.

4. Kafka will start a new log segment after 24 hours, regardless of the size. Old log segments will be retained for 7 days or until the total log size exceeds 1 GB, whichever comes first.

Choose the correct answer.

Response:

The correct answer is **1. Kafka will start a new log segment when the current segment reaches 1 GB in size or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. Old log segments will be retained for 7 days.**

Explanation:

1. **Correct**. The given configurations control the log segment creation and retention policies for Kafka:
   - `log.segment.bytes=1073741824` specifies that a new log segment should be started when the current segment reaches 1 GB (1073741824 bytes) in size.
   - `log.segment.ms=86400000` specifies that a new log segment should be started after 24 hours (86400000 milliseconds), even if the current segment has not reached the size limit.
   - `log.retention.bytes=-1` indicates that there is no size-based retention limit for log segments. The value -1 means that log segments will not be deleted based on their total size.
   - `log.retention.ms=604800000` specifies that log segments should be retained for 7 days (604800000 milliseconds) before being eligible for deletion.

   Therefore, Kafka will start a new log segment when either the size limit (1 GB) or the time limit (24 hours) is reached, whichever comes first. Old log segments will be retained for 7 days based on the `log.retention.ms` setting.

2. **Incorrect**. While the log segment creation policy is correctly described, the retention policy is incorrect. Old log segments will not be retained indefinitely, as `log.retention.ms` is set to 7 days (604800000 milliseconds).

3. **Incorrect**. The log segment creation policy is partially correct, but it ignores the time-based limit specified by `log.segment.ms`. Additionally, the retention policy is incorrect, as `log.retention.bytes=-1` means that there is no size-based retention limit.

4. **Incorrect**. The log segment creation policy is incorrect, as it ignores the size-based limit specified by `log.segment.bytes`. The retention policy is also incorrect, as `log.retention.bytes=-1` means that there is no size-based retention limit.
