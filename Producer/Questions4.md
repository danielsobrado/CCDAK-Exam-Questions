## Question 31

What does the `acks=all` setting in the Kafka producer configuration ensure?

- A. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all replicas
- B. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to the leader replica
- C. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas
- D. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgment and will consider the write successful immediately

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When the `acks` parameter is set to "all" in the Kafka producer configuration, the producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas (ISRs). In-sync replicas are the replicas that are currently up-to-date with the leader and are considered to have the latest data. Setting `acks=all` ensures the highest level of durability, as the producer will wait for the message to be persisted on multiple replicas before considering the write successful. However, this setting also introduces additional latency, as the producer needs to wait for acknowledgments from all ISRs before proceeding.

**Answer:** C

## Question 32

What is the purpose of the `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations?

- A. To specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster
- B. To set the maximum number of requests the client can send or receive
- C. To determine the compression type used for message production or consumption
- D. To control the maximum amount of memory the client can use for buffering

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
The `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations is used to specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster. It is an optional setting that helps in identifying and tracking the client's activity in the cluster. When set, the `client.id` is included in the metadata of requests sent by the client, making it easier to correlate and monitor client behavior. It can be useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to identify specific clients in the logs and metrics. The `client.id` does not have any impact on the functional behavior of the client, such as the number of requests, compression type, or memory usage. It is purely used for identification and monitoring purposes.

**Answer:** A

## Question 33

What happens if multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value?

- A. The clients will share the same configuration and connection pooling
- B. The clients will be treated as a single logical client by the Kafka brokers
- C. The behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors
- D. The Kafka brokers will reject the connection attempts from clients with duplicate `client.id`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
If multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value, the behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors. The `client.id` is meant to be a unique identifier for each client, and Kafka brokers do not enforce uniqueness or perform any special handling when multiple clients have the same `client.id`. Using the same `client.id` for multiple clients can cause confusion and make it difficult to distinguish between the activities of different clients in logs and metrics. It may also lead to incorrect correlation of requests and responses, as the brokers may attribute the actions of one client to another. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to assign a unique `client.id` to each Kafka client in a cluster.

**Answer:** C

## Question 34

If a producer sends a message with a key to a topic with 5 partitions, which partition will the message be written to?

- A. The partition is randomly selected
- B. The partition is determined based on the hash of the message key
- C. The partition is always the first partition (partition 0)
- D. The partition is determined by the broker

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a producer sends a message with a key to a topic, the partition to which the message is written is determined based on the hash of the message key. Kafka's default partitioner uses the murmur2 hash function to compute the hash of the key and then maps it to a specific partition.

The process works as follows:
1. The producer calculates the hash of the message key using the murmur2 hash function.
2. The hash value is then modulo'd by the number of partitions in the topic to determine the partition index.
3. The message is sent to the corresponding partition based on the calculated partition index.

This means that messages with the same key will always be sent to the same partition, ensuring that they are processed in the order they were sent.

The partition is not randomly selected, nor is it always the first partition. The broker does not determine the partition for keyed messages; it is determined by the producer based on the hash of the message key.

**Answer:** B

## Question 35

What happens if a producer sends a message without a key to a topic with 3 partitions?

- A. The message is discarded
- B. The message is sent to a randomly selected partition
- C. The message is sent to all partitions
- D. The message is sent to the partition with the least amount of data

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a producer sends a message without a key to a topic, the message is sent to a randomly selected partition. In the absence of a key, Kafka's default partitioner uses a round-robin approach to distribute messages evenly across all available partitions.

Here's how it works:
1. The producer maintains an internal counter that keeps track of the last partition it sent a message to.
2. When a message without a key is sent, the producer increments the counter and selects the next partition in a round-robin fashion.
3. The message is sent to the selected partition.
4. The counter is incremented again, and the process repeats for subsequent messages.

This round-robin approach ensures that messages without keys are evenly distributed across all partitions in the topic.

The message is not discarded, sent to all partitions, or sent to the partition with the least amount of data. The partition selection for messages without keys is based on the round-robin algorithm to achieve a balanced distribution.

**Answer:** B

## Question 36

Can a producer guarantee the order of messages within a partition when sending messages with different keys?

- A. Yes, messages within a partition are always guaranteed to be in the same order as they were sent by the producer
- B. No, messages with different keys can be written to the same partition in a different order than they were sent
- C. It depends on the configuration of the producer
- D. It depends on the configuration of the topic

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
A producer cannot guarantee the order of messages within a partition when sending messages with different keys. While Kafka guarantees the order of messages within a partition for a given key, it does not guarantee the relative order of messages across different keys.

When a producer sends messages with different keys to the same topic, the messages are partitioned based on the hash of their keys. Messages with the same key will always be sent to the same partition and will be ordered within that partition. However, messages with different keys may be sent to different partitions or even to the same partition but in a different order than they were sent by the producer.

This is because the order of messages in a partition is determined by the order in which they are written to the partition, not by the order in which they were sent by the producer. If messages with different keys are sent to the same partition, their order within that partition depends on the timing and interleaving of the write operations.

The configuration of the producer or the topic does not affect the ordering guarantee for messages with different keys. The order is determined by the partitioning mechanism and the timing of the write operations.

**Answer:** B

## Question 37

What happens when a producer tries to send a message to a partition whose leader replica is not in-sync?

- A. The producer receives a `NotLeaderOrFollowerException` and retries sending the message
- B. The producer waits until the leader replica becomes in-sync before sending the message
- C. The message is automatically routed to another in-sync replica
- D. The producer receives a `LeaderNotAvailableException` and the message is discarded

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a producer tries to send a message to a partition whose leader replica is not in-sync, the producer will receive a `NotLeaderOrFollowerException`. This exception indicates that the broker the producer is connected to is not the leader for the partition and cannot accept writes.

In this situation, the producer typically retries sending the message after a short backoff period. The producer will attempt to refresh its metadata to obtain the current leader information for the partition. Once the producer has the updated leader information, it will retry sending the message to the new leader.

The producer does not wait indefinitely for the leader replica to become in-sync. It proactively refreshes its metadata and retries sending the message to the updated leader.

The message is not automatically routed to another in-sync replica. The producer specifically sends the message to the partition leader, and it is the leader's responsibility to replicate the message to the followers.

If the producer is unable to send the message after multiple retries, it may eventually timeout or return an error to the application, depending on its configuration. The message is not automatically discarded; it is the application's responsibility to handle the failure and decide whether to retry or discard the message.

**Answer:** A

## Question 38

In a topic with a replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas` set to 2, what happens when a producer sends a message with `acks=all` and two replicas are not in-sync?

- A. The producer receives an acknowledgment and the message is successfully written
- B. The producer receives a `NotEnoughReplicasException` and the message is not written
- C. The producer waits indefinitely until at least two replicas become in-sync
- D. The message is written to the leader replica and the producer receives an acknowledgment

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a topic has a replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas` is set to 2, it means that at least 2 replicas (including the leader) must be in-sync for a write to be considered successful when `acks=all`.

In the scenario where a producer sends a message with `acks=all` and two replicas are not in-sync, the producer will receive a `NotEnoughReplicasException`, and the message will not be written to the topic. The `acks=all` configuration requires acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas before considering a write successful.

Since the topic has `min.insync.replicas` set to 2, the leader replica alone is not sufficient to meet the acknowledgment requirement. The producer will not receive an acknowledgment, and the message will not be written to the topic.

The producer does not wait indefinitely for the replicas to become in-sync. It immediately fails the write operation and returns an exception to the application.

Even though the message may be written to the leader replica, the producer does not receive an acknowledgment because the `acks=all` requirement is not satisfied. The message is not considered successfully written until the required number of in-sync replicas have acknowledged the write.

**Answer:** B
