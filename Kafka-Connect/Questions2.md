## Question 12:

A streaming media company uses Kafka to ingest viewer watch history for real-time recommendation updates. Viewer engagement varies greatly, with peak times during new content releases. To handle variable ingestion rates, which configuration should be optimized?

1. Adjust the replication factor of the watch history topic in real-time to handle the increased data volume.
2. Increase and decrease the number of Kafka Connect Sink Connector tasks to efficiently write watch history data into Kafka.
3. Scale the number of Kafka Streams applications processing the watch history data according to the ingestion rate.
4. Dynamically modify the number of partitions in the watch history topic to manage the load during peak engagement times.

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Correct Answer:** 3. Scale the number of Kafka Streams applications processing the watch history data according to the ingestion rate.

**Explanation:**

Kafka Streams applications are responsible for processing data from Kafka topics in real-time. By scaling the number of Kafka Streams application instances, the company can adjust the processing capacity to match the variable ingestion rates, especially during peak times.

Key benefits of this approach:
- Scaling up during high engagement ensures that the system can handle increased data volumes without latency.
- Scaling down during low engagement periods optimizes resource utilization and reduces costs.
- This method allows for dynamic adjustment based on processing load rather than modifying Kafka's underlying configurations, which can be more complex and less responsive to real-time fluctuations.

**Why other options are less suitable:**

1. Adjusting the replication factor in real-time is not practical and does not directly address the issue of variable ingestion rates. Replication factor affects data redundancy and fault tolerance, not processing capacity.
2. Kafka Connect Sink Connectors are used to export data from Kafka to external systems, not for ingesting data into Kafka. This option is not relevant for the given scenario of ingesting viewer watch history.
3. Dynamically modifying the number of partitions is operationally complex and can cause data rebalancing issues. It's not recommended to change partition counts frequently in response to fluctuating loads.



The correct answer is **2. Increase and decrease the number of Kafka Connect Sink Connector tasks to efficiently write watch history data into Kafka.**

## Question 19:
An IoT company collects temperature and humidity data from sensors deployed in various locations. The goal is to correlate this environmental data with location-specific weather forecasts retrieved from an external API. Which approach best facilitates this integration and processing within the Kafka ecosystem?

1. Ingest sensor data into a Kafka topic using MQTT connectors. Separately, use an external service to fetch weather forecasts, storing this data in a Kafka topic via the HTTP Source Connector. Utilize Kafka Streams to join sensor data with weather forecasts based on location and timestamp, outputting enriched data to another topic.
2. Directly stream sensor data and weather forecasts into Kafka using custom Kafka Producers implemented in Python. These producers perform API calls to retrieve forecasts, merge this data with sensor readings, and produce the combined records into a single Kafka topic.
3. Use the MQTT Source Connector to ingest sensor data into Kafka. Write a Kafka Streams application that performs REST API calls to the weather forecast service for each sensor data record processed, enriching and producing enriched records to a new topic.
4. Implement an MQTT proxy to capture sensor data into Kafka. Concurrently, utilize Kafka Connect with the JDBC Sink Connector to store sensor data in a relational database, from which an external cron job fetches weather forecasts, merges them with sensor data, and re-ingests the enriched data back into Kafka via JDBC Source Connector.

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

The correct answer is **1. Ingest sensor data into a Kafka topic using MQTT connectors. Separately, use an external service to fetch weather forecasts, storing this data in a Kafka topic via the HTTP Source Connector. Utilize Kafka Streams to join sensor data with weather forecasts based on location and timestamp, outputting enriched data to another topic.**

**Explanation:**
- **1.** Correct. This approach leverages the strengths of Kafka's ecosystem for real-time data integration and processing. MQTT connectors efficiently ingest sensor data, while the HTTP Source Connector handles external API data. Kafka Streams then enables complex processing, such as joining data streams based on key attributes like location and time.
- **2.** While using custom producers allows for flexible data ingestion and preprocessing, it bypasses Kafka's robust and scalable data integration capabilities, such as fault tolerance and parallel processing provided by connectors and Kafka Streams.
- **3.** Integrating external API calls directly within a Kafka Streams application for each record can introduce significant latency and potential rate limit issues with the weather API, making it less efficient for enriching streaming data at scale.
- **4.** This method introduces unnecessary complexity and latency by cycling data through external systems and back into Kafka. It also fails to utilize Kafka's real-time streaming capabilities efficiently, such as stream processing for data enrichment without the need for intermediate storage.

## Question 20:
A retail chain wants to integrate sales data from their Point of Sale (POS) systems across multiple stores into Kafka for real-time analysis and inventory management. Each store's POS system dumps sales records into a local SQL database. The integration needs to account for network bandwidth limitations. Which strategy optimally addresses these requirements?

1. Deploy Kafka Connect with the JDBC Source Connector at each store to ingest sales data into Kafka, using Single Message Transforms (SMTs) to filter and reduce the size of the data on the fly. Aggregate this data centrally using a Kafka Streams application for inventory analysis.
2. Utilize log-based Change Data Capture (CDC) connectors to monitor changes in each store's SQL database, streaming only new or changed sales records into Kafka. This minimizes network usage and enables real-time central processing with Kafka Streams.
3. Implement custom Kafka Producers within the POS systems to directly publish sales data to Kafka, compressing messages to mitigate network bandwidth issues. Use Kafka Streams for processing and inventory management centrally.
4. Set up a central database to aggregate sales data from all stores nightly. Use the JDBC Sink Connector to transfer this aggregated data into Kafka for next-day inventory analysis, relying on batch processing rather than real-time analysis.

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

The correct answer is **2. Utilize log-based Change Data Capture (CDC) connectors to monitor changes in each store's SQL database, streaming only new or changed sales records into Kafka. This minimizes network usage and enables real-time central processing with Kafka Streams.**

**Explanation:**
- **1.** While JDBC Source Connectors are capable of ingesting data into Kafka, using them without consideration for data volume and network bandwidth can lead to inefficiencies, especially in bandwidth-limited environments.
- **2.** Correct. CDC connectors are designed to efficiently capture and stream only the incremental changes (new or updated sales records), significantly reducing network bandwidth requirements and enabling effective real-time data integration and processing.
- **3.** Custom producers offer flexibility but require additional development and maintenance effort. Compressing messages addresses bandwidth concerns but doesn't reduce the volume of data sent as effectively as streaming only changes.
- **4.** This approach shifts towards batch processing, which does not meet the requirement for real-time analysis and fails to leverage
