## Question 11

What is the role of the `ssl.truststore.location` and `ssl.truststore.password` configurations in Kafka?

- A. To specify the location and password of the keystore for storing the broker's private key
- B. To specify the location and password of the truststore for storing trusted client certificates
- C. To specify the location and password of the keystore for storing trusted broker certificates
- D. To specify the location and password of the truststore for verifying broker certificates

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

The `ssl.truststore.location` and `ssl.truststore.password` configurations in Kafka are used to specify the location and password of the truststore for verifying broker certificates. In an SSL/TLS setup, the truststore contains the trusted certificates of the Kafka brokers. When a client or another broker establishes a secure connection to a Kafka broker, it uses the certificates in the truststore to verify the identity of the broker. The `ssl.truststore.location` configuration specifies the file path of the truststore on the client or broker's file system, and the `ssl.truststore.password` configuration provides the password needed to access the truststore. These configurations are crucial for enabling trust verification and ensuring secure communication between clients and brokers.

**Answer:** D

## Question 12

How can you enable SSL/TLS encryption for communication between Kafka brokers?

- A. Set `ssl.enabled.protocols` to `SSL` in the broker configuration
- B. Set `security.inter.broker.protocol` to `SSL` in the broker configuration
- C. Set `ssl.client.auth` to `required` in the broker configuration
- D. Set `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` to `HTTPS` in the broker configuration

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

To enable SSL/TLS encryption for communication between Kafka brokers, you need to set the `security.inter.broker.protocol` configuration to `SSL` in the broker configuration. By default, Kafka brokers communicate with each other using plaintext. By setting `security.inter.broker.protocol` to `SSL`, you instruct the brokers to use SSL/TLS encryption for inter-broker communication. This ensures that all data exchanged between brokers, including replication traffic and controller communication, is encrypted and secure. When enabling SSL/TLS for inter-broker communication, you also need to configure the appropriate SSL/TLS settings, such as the keystore and truststore locations and passwords, to establish secure connections between the brokers.

**Answer:** B

</details>

## Question 13

What is the purpose of the `ssl.client.auth` configuration in Kafka?

- A. To specify the SSL/TLS protocol version to be used for client authentication
- B. To enable or disable SSL/TLS encryption for client connections
- C. To configure the client authentication mode (none, optional, or required)
- D. To set the location of the client certificate for authentication

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

The `ssl.client.auth` configuration in Kafka is used to configure the client authentication mode when SSL/TLS is enabled. It determines how the Kafka broker handles client authentication during the SSL/TLS handshake process. The `ssl.client.auth` configuration can be set to one of three values:

- `none`: Client authentication is not required. The broker does not request or verify client certificates.
- `requested`: Client authentication is optional. The broker requests client certificates but does not require them. If a client provides a certificate, it will be verified.
- `required`: Client authentication is mandatory. The broker requires clients to provide a valid certificate for authentication.

- B. configuring `ssl.client.auth`, you can enforce the desired level of client authentication security in your Kafka cluster.

**Answer:** C

**Area:** Security

</details>

## Question 14

What happens when `ssl.client.auth` is set to `required` in the Kafka broker configuration?

- A. Clients are required to provide a valid certificate for authentication
- B. Clients can choose to provide a certificate optionally
- C. Client authentication is disabled, and no certificates are requested
- D. The broker uses the default SSL/TLS protocol version for client authentication

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

When the `ssl.client.auth` configuration is set to `required` in the Kafka broker configuration, clients are required to provide a valid certificate for authentication. In this mode, the Kafka broker enforces mandatory client authentication during the SSL/TLS handshake process. When a client establishes a connection to the broker, the broker requests the client's certificate and verifies its validity against the trusted certificates stored in the broker's truststore. Only clients with a valid and trusted certificate are allowed to proceed with the connection. If a client fails to provide a certificate or provides an invalid certificate, the connection is rejected. Setting `ssl.client.auth` to `required` ensures that all clients connecting to the Kafka cluster are authenticated and trusted.

**Answer:** A

</details>

## Question 15

What is the default value of the `ssl.client.auth` configuration in Kafka?

- A. `none`
- B. `requested`
- C. `required`
- D. `optional`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

The default value of the `ssl.client.auth` configuration in Kafka is `none`. When `ssl.client.auth` is not explicitly set in the Kafka broker configuration, it assumes the default value of `none`. In this mode, client authentication is not required, and the Kafka broker does not request or verify client certificates during the SSL/TLS handshake process. Clients can establish connections to the broker without providing any authentication credentials. This default behavior prioritizes simplicity and ease of use but does not enforce client authentication. If you need to enable client authentication, you must explicitly set `ssl.client.auth` to `requested` or `required` in the broker configuration.

**Answer:** A

</details>

## Question 16

What is the purpose of the `sasl.kerberos.service.name` configuration in Kafka?

- A. To specify the Kerberos principal name for the Kafka broker
- B. To set the Kerberos realm for SASL authentication
- C. To configure the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) hostname
- D. To define the service name used by Kafka brokers for SASL authentication

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

The `sasl.kerberos.service.name` configuration in Kafka is used to define the service name used by Kafka brokers for SASL authentication when Kerberos is enabled. In a Kerberos-based SASL authentication setup, Kafka clients and brokers use Kerberos tickets to authenticate with each other. The `sasl.kerberos.service.name` configuration specifies the service name that Kafka brokers use to obtain Kerberos tickets from the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC). This service name is typically set to `kafka` but can be customized based on your Kerberos setup. It is important to ensure that the service name configured in Kafka matches the service name used in the Kerberos principal and keytab files for the Kafka brokers.

**Answer:** D

</details>

## Question 17

What is the role of the `sasl.jaas.config` configuration in Kafka SASL authentication?

- A. To specify the path to the JAAS configuration file for SASL authentication
- B. To set the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication (e.g., PLAIN, SCRAM)
- C. To configure the SASL client and server callbacks for authentication
- D. To enable or disable SASL authentication in Kafka

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

The `sasl.jaas.config` configuration in Kafka is used to specify the JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) configuration for SASL authentication. JAAS is a pluggable authentication framework used by Kafka to configure and handle authentication mechanisms. The `sasl.jaas.config` configuration allows you to provide the necessary authentication details, such as the login module, principal, and credentials, directly in the Kafka configuration. It eliminates the need for a separate JAAS configuration file. The value of `sasl.jaas.config` is a string that represents the JAAS configuration, including the login module class, principal, and any additional options required for authentication. It is a convenient way to configure SASL authentication settings directly in the Kafka broker or client configuration.

**Answer:** C

</details>

## Question 18

What is the purpose of the `sasl.mechanism` configuration in Kafka SASL authentication?

- A. To specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication (e.g., PLAIN, SCRAM)
- B. To configure the SASL client and server callbacks for authentication
- C. To set the path to the JAAS configuration file for SASL authentication
- D. To enable or disable SASL authentication in Kafka

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

The `sasl.mechanism` configuration in Kafka is used to specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) is a framework that provides authentication and optional encryption for network protocols. Kafka supports multiple SASL mechanisms, such as PLAIN, SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism), and GSSAPI (Kerberos). The `sasl.mechanism` configuration allows you to choose the specific SASL mechanism that Kafka should use for authentication. For example, setting `sasl.mechanism=PLAIN` configures Kafka to use the PLAIN mechanism, which transmits credentials in plaintext. Setting `sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256` configures Kafka to use the SCRAM mechanism with SHA-256 hashing for secure password-based authentication. The available SASL mechanisms depend on the Kafka version and the security libraries installed.

**Answer:** A

</details>

## Question 19

What security protocol does Kafka use by default for communication between clients and brokers?

- A. SSL/TLS
- B. SASL_PLAINTEXT
- C. PLAINTEXT
- D. SASL_SSL

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

- B. default, Kafka uses the PLAINTEXT security protocol for communication between clients and brokers. The PLAINTEXT protocol does not provide any encryption or authentication and sends data in plain text over the network. It is the simplest and most basic security protocol in Kafka, offering no security measures out of the box. While PLAINTEXT is the default protocol, it is not recommended for production environments or sensitive data transmission. Instead, it is strongly advised to use more secure protocols like SSL/TLS (SSL) or SASL (SASL_PLAINTEXT or SASL_SSL) to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication between clients and brokers.

**Answer:** C

</details>

## Question 20

Which security protocol in Kafka provides encryption for data in transit but does not offer authentication?

- A. PLAINTEXT
- B. SASL_PLAINTEXT
- C. SSL
- D. SASL_SSL


<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

In Kafka, the SSL security protocol provides encryption for data in transit between clients and brokers but does not offer authentication. When the SSL protocol is used, all the data exchanged between clients and brokers is encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data. However, SSL alone does not handle authentication of the clients or brokers. It focuses solely on encrypting the communication channel. To achieve authentication in conjunction with encryption, you need to use the SASL_SSL protocol, which combines SSL encryption with SASL authentication. Alternatively, you can use SSL with separate authentication mechanisms like client certificates or Kerberos.

**Answer:** C
