## Question 1

What happens when you set `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 in a Kafka producer?

- A. It increases the throughput of the producer
- B. It increases the latency of the producer
- C. It can lead to out-of-order delivery of messages
- D. It has no effect on the producer's behavior

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 in a Kafka producer allows multiple requests to be sent to the broker in parallel, without waiting for the previous requests to be acknowledged. While this can improve throughput, it also means that if a request fails and needs to be retried, the subsequent requests may have already been processed, leading to out-of-order delivery.

- A is incorrect because while it can improve throughput, it's not the only effect.
- B is incorrect. In fact, it can potentially decrease latency by allowing more requests in flight.
- D is incorrect because it does have a significant effect on the producer's behavior.

## Question 2

What is the effect of setting `acks=0` in a Kafka producer?

- A. The producer will wait for the broker to acknowledge the message before sending the next one
- B. The producer will wait for the leader and all replicas to acknowledge the message
- C. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker
- D. The producer will throw an exception if the broker does not acknowledge the message

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
When `acks` is set to 0 in a Kafka producer, the producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker before considering the send operation successful. This means the producer will fire and forget the message, providing no guarantees about whether the broker has received it.

- A and B are incorrect because they describe the behaviors of `acks=1` and `acks=all` respectively.
- D is incorrect because no exception is thrown in this case. The producer simply continues sending messages without waiting for acknowledgement.

</details>

## Question 3

What is the relationship between `request.timeout.ms` and `delivery.timeout.ms` in a Kafka producer?

- A. `request.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `delivery.timeout.ms`
- B. `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms`
- C. They should always be set to the same value
- D. They are independent and can be set to any value

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In a Kafka producer, `request.timeout.ms` configures the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a response from the server when sending a request, while `delivery.timeout.ms` sets an upper bound on the time to report success or failure to the application after a call to `send()`.

If `delivery.timeout.ms` is smaller than `request.timeout.ms`, the client can time out and report a failure to the application before the request timeout even occurs. Therefore, `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms` to allow the full request timeout to elapse before reporting a timeout failure to the application.

- A is incorrect because it's the other way around.
- C is incorrect because they serve different purposes and can have different values.
- D is incorrect because there is a recommended relationship between the two settings.

</details>

## Question 4

A Kafka producer application needs to send messages to a topic. The messages do not require any particular order. Which of the following properties are mandatory in the producer configuration? (Select two)

- A. `compression.type`
- B. `partitioner.class`
- C. `bootstrap.servers`
- D. `key.serializer`
- E. `value.serializer`
- F. `client.id`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C, E

**Explanation:**
For a Kafka producer application to function, it must know how to connect to the Kafka cluster and how to serialize the message values. Therefore, the mandatory properties are:

- `bootstrap.servers`: This specifies the list of Kafka brokers the producer should contact to bootstrap initial cluster metadata.
- `value.serializer`: This specifies the serializer class for message values.

The other options are not strictly mandatory:

- A: `compression.type` is optional. If not set, the producer will send uncompressed messages.
- B: `partitioner.class` is optional. If not set, the default partitioner will be used, which is sufficient for messages that don't require a particular order.
- D: `key.serializer` is only required if the messages have keys. It's not mandatory if the messages don't have keys.
- F: `client.id` is optional. It's used to identify the producer application, but the producer will work without it.

</details>

## Question 5

What is the purpose of setting `compression.type` in a Kafka producer configuration?

- A. To specify the compression algorithm used when sending data to Kafka
- B. To specify the compression algorithm used when storing data on Kafka brokers
- C. To enable or disable compression for the producer
- D. To set the compression level for the producer

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `compression.type` setting in a Kafka producer configuration is used to specify the compression algorithm that the producer will use when sending data to Kafka. The available options are:

- `none`: No compression (default)
- `gzip`: GZIP compression
- `snappy`: Snappy compression
- `lz4`: LZ4 compression
- `zstd`: ZStandard compression

The compression is applied by the producer before sending the data, and the broker will store the compressed data as is. The consumer will decompress the data when it receives it.

- B is incorrect because the broker does not perform compression, it just stores what it receives.
- C is incorrect because `compression.type` does not enable/disable compression, it specifies the algorithm. Compression is enabled by default if an algorithm is specified.
- D is incorrect because `compression.type` sets the algorithm, not the compression level. Some compression types (like `zstd`) have separate settings for compression level.

</details>

## Question 6

What is the effect of enabling compression on the producer side in Kafka?

- A. Reduced producer memory usage
- B. Increased consumer CPU usage
- C. Reduced network bandwidth usage
- D. Increased end-to-end latency

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Enabling compression on the producer side in Kafka can significantly reduce the amount of network bandwidth used when sending data from the producer to the Kafka brokers. The compressed data takes up less space on the wire, thus reducing network I/O.

However, there are trade-offs:

- A is incorrect because compression actually increases memory usage on the producer side, as the data needs to be held in memory during the compression process.
- B is correct because the consumer will need to use CPU cycles to decompress the data when it receives it.
- D is correct because compression and decompression add some processing time, slightly increasing the end-to-end latency.

So enabling producer compression is a trade-off between network bandwidth and CPU/memory usage. It's most beneficial when network bandwidth is the bottleneck.

## Question 7

What is the relationship between `batch.size` and `linger.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. They are mutually exclusive settings
- B. `linger.ms` is only relevant if `batch.size` is set to 0
- C. `batch.size` is only relevant if `linger.ms` is set to 0
- D. They work together to control when a batch is considered ready to send

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In the Kafka producer, `batch.size` and `linger.ms` work together to control when a batch of messages is considered ready to send to the broker:

- `batch.size` sets the maximum amount of data that will be included in a single batch.
- `linger.ms` sets the maximum amount of time a batch will wait before being sent to the broker.

A batch will be sent when either `batch.size` is reached or `linger.ms` has passed, whichever comes first.

- A is incorrect because the settings are not mutually exclusive, they work together.
- B and C are incorrect because both settings are always relevant, regardless of the value of the other setting. If `batch.size` is 0, batching is effectively disabled. If `linger.ms` is 0, the producer will not wait at all and will send batches as soon as they are ready.

Tuning these settings can have a significant impact on producer performance and throughput.

</details>

## Question 8

What is the effect of increasing `batch.size` in a Kafka producer configuration?

- A. It increases the maximum size of each individual message
- B. It increases the maximum number of messages that can be sent in a single request
- C. It increases the maximum time a batch will wait before being sent
- D. It increases the maximum amount of memory the producer will use for buffering

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In a Kafka producer, the `batch.size` setting controls the maximum number of bytes that will be sent in a single request to the broker. By increasing `batch.size`, you allow the producer to pack more messages into each request, which can improve throughput by reducing the overhead of making many smaller requests.

However, there are trade-offs to consider:

- A larger `batch.size` means the producer will buffer more data in memory before sending, which can increase memory usage (D).
- A larger `batch.size` can also increase the latency of message sends, as the producer may wait longer for a batch to fill up before sending.

It's important to note that `batch.size` does not affect the size of individual messages (A), only how many messages can be batched together in a single request. The maximum individual message size is controlled by a separate `max.request.size` setting.

Also, `batch.size` does not directly control the time a batch will wait (C). That is controlled by the `linger.ms` setting.

</details>

## Question 9

What is the relationship between `linger.ms` and `request.timeout.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. They are redundant settings that control the same thing
- B. `linger.ms` should always be set higher than `request.timeout.ms`
- C. `request.timeout.ms` should always be set higher than `linger.ms`
- D. They control independent aspects of the producer behavior

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
While `linger.ms` and `request.timeout.ms` both relate to the timing of when the Kafka producer sends data, they control different aspects and their values should be coordinated:

- `linger.ms` controls the maximum amount of time a batch will wait before being sent to the broker. A higher value can increase batching and thus throughput, at the cost of some latency.
- `request.timeout.ms` controls the maximum amount of time the producer will wait for a response from the broker before considering the request failed.

It's important that `request.timeout.ms` is set higher than `linger.ms`. If `request.timeout.ms` is lower, the producer might timeout a request before the `linger.ms` period is over, leading to failed sends and potential data loss.

A good rule of thumb is to set `request.timeout.ms` to be at least a few seconds higher than `linger.ms`, to account for potential network or broker latencies on top of the expected linger time.

- A is incorrect because the settings control different things.
- B is incorrect because it's the other way around.
- D is incorrect because while the settings do control independent things, their values should be coordinated.

</details>

## Question 10

What happens if `linger.ms` is set to 0 in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. The producer will never send any messages
- B. The producer will wait indefinitely for each batch to fill up before sending
- C. The producer will send each message as soon as it is received, without batching
- D. The producer will use the default linger time

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `linger.ms` to 0 in the Kafka producer configuration means that the producer will not wait at all before sending a batch of messages. In effect, this disables batching: each message will be sent to the broker as soon as it is received by the producer.

This can be useful in scenarios where minimizing latency is more important than maximizing throughput. With `linger.ms=0`, each message is sent immediately, minimizing the time between when a message is produced and when it is available to be consumed.

However, disabling batching can significantly reduce throughput, as the producer will make many more requests to the broker, each carrying fewer messages. This increases the overhead of the request-response cycle.

In most cases, it's recommended to set `linger.ms` to a small but non-zero value, like 5-100ms, to strike a balance between latency and throughput.

- A is incorrect because a linger time of 0 does not prevent the producer from sending messages, it just sends them immediately.
- B is incorrect because a linger time of 0 means the producer won't wait at all, not that it will wait indefinitely.
- D is incorrect because 0 is a valid setting for `linger.ms`, not a signal to use the default.
