## Question 11
What is the purpose of the `kafka-dump-log` tool in KRaft mode?

- A. To display the contents of the KRaft metadata log
- B. To modify the Kafka broker configuration
- C. To list the available Kafka topics
- D. To monitor the Kafka cluster performance

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka-dump-log` tool is used to display the contents of the KRaft metadata log. It allows you to inspect the log segments and snapshots for the cluster metadata directory.

By running the `kafka-dump-log` tool with the `--cluster-metadata-decoder` flag and specifying the path to the metadata log files, you can decode and print the records in the log segments. For example:

bin/kafka-dump-log --cluster-metadata-decoder --files /path/to/kraft/metadata/log/00000000000000000000.log

This command will scan the specified log files and decode the metadata records, providing insights into the contents of the KRaft metadata log.

B is incorrect because modifying the Kafka broker configuration is not the purpose of the `kafka-dump-log` tool. Broker configurations are typically modified using the `server.properties` file or the `kafka-configs` tool.

C is incorrect because listing the available Kafka topics is not the responsibility of the `kafka-dump-log` tool. You can use the `kafka-topics` tool to list the existing topics in the cluster.

D is incorrect because monitoring the Kafka cluster performance is not the primary function of the `kafka-dump-log` tool. There are dedicated monitoring tools and metrics for tracking cluster performance.

## Question 12
What is the purpose of the `kafka-metadata-shell` tool in KRaft mode?

- A. To modify the Kafka broker configuration
- B. To list the available Kafka topics
- C. To monitor the Kafka cluster performance
- D. To interactively inspect the KRaft metadata

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka-metadata-shell` tool is used to interactively inspect the KRaft metadata. It provides a shell-like interface for exploring the contents of the metadata log and examining the state of the cluster.

By running the `kafka-metadata-shell` tool and specifying the directory containing the metadata log, you can enter an interactive shell where you can execute various commands to analyze the metadata. For example:

bin/kafka-metadata-shell --snapshot /path/to/kraft/metadata/log

Once inside the shell, you can use commands like `ls` to list the available metadata directories, `cat` to view the contents of specific metadata files, and navigate through the metadata hierarchy.

The `kafka-metadata-shell` tool is particularly useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes, as it allows you to inspect the internal state of the KRaft metadata in a user-friendly manner.

A is incorrect because modifying the Kafka broker configuration is not the purpose of the `kafka-metadata-shell` tool. Broker configurations are typically modified using the `server.properties` file or the `kafka-configs` tool.

B is incorrect because listing the available Kafka topics is not the responsibility of the `kafka-metadata-shell` tool. You can use the `kafka-topics` tool to list the existing topics in the cluster.

C is incorrect because monitoring the Kafka cluster performance is not the primary function of the `kafka-metadata-shell` tool. There are dedicated monitoring tools and metrics for tracking cluster performance.

## Question 13
What is the significance of the `kafka.controller:type=QuorumController,name=LastCommittedRecordOffset` metric in KRaft mode?

- A. It indicates the offset of the last record that was applied by the controller to the metadata partition
- B. It represents the number of records that have been committed to the metadata partition
- C. It measures the lag between the active controller and the last committed record in the metadata partition
- D. It tracks the offset of the last record that was committed by the active controller

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka.controller:type=QuorumController,name=LastCommittedRecordOffset` metric holds significant importance as it tracks the offset of the last record that was committed by the active controller in the metadata partition.

The active controller is responsible for committing records to the metadata partition, which contains crucial information about the cluster's state, such as topic configurations, partition assignments, and broker metadata. The `LastCommittedRecordOffset` metric provides visibility into the progress of the active controller in terms of committing these important records.

Monitoring the `LastCommittedRecordOffset` metric is essential for ensuring that the active controller is making progress and committing new records to the metadata partition. It allows you to track the latest committed offset and detect any potential issues or delays in the commitment process.

A is incorrect because the metric represents the offset of the last committed record, not the last applied record. The last applied record is tracked by a different metric, `kafka.controller:type=QuorumController,name=LastAppliedRecordOffset`.

B is incorrect because the metric represents the offset of the last committed record, not the total number of committed records.

C is incorrect because the metric does not measure the lag between the active controller and the last committed record. The lag is tracked by a separate metric, `kafka.controller:type=QuorumController,name=LastAppliedRecordLagMs`.

## Question 14
What is the purpose of the `metadata.max.idle.interval.ms` configuration in KRaft mode?

- A. To set the maximum time allowed for a metadata request to be idle before it is cancelled
- B. To specify the maximum time the active controller can be idle before a new controller is elected
- C. To configure the frequency at which the active controller writes no-op records to the metadata partition
- D. To define the maximum interval allowed between two consecutive metadata log segments

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `metadata.max.idle.interval.ms` configuration is used to specify the frequency at which the active controller writes no-op records to the metadata partition.

No-op records, short for "no operation" records, are dummy records that the active controller periodically appends to the metadata partition. These records serve as a heartbeat mechanism to keep the metadata partition alive and prevent it from becoming idle for an extended period.

By setting the `metadata.max.idle.interval.ms` configuration, you can control how often the active controller writes these no-op records. The default value is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds), which means that if no other records are being appended to the metadata partition, the active controller will write a no-op record every 5 seconds.

Writing no-op records helps in maintaining the liveness of the metadata partition and ensures that the followers can continuously replicate the latest metadata changes. It also aids in keeping the metadata partition log up to date and prevents excessive log compaction.

A is incorrect because the `metadata.max.idle.interval.ms` configuration is not related to the idleness of metadata requests. It pertains to the idleness of the metadata partition itself.

B is incorrect because the configuration does not specify the maximum idle time for the active controller before a new controller is elected. Controller election is governed by a separate mechanism.

D is incorrect because the configuration does not define the maximum interval between consecutive metadata log segments. It controls the frequency of writing no-op records within a single log segment.

## Question 15
What is the role of the `kafka.controller:type=QuorumController,name=MaxFollowerLag` metric in KRaft mode?

- A. It measures the maximum lag between the active controller and the last committed record in the metadata partition
- B. It indicates the maximum lag between the active controller and the followers in terms of metadata records
- C. It represents the maximum number of records that a follower can lag behind the active controller
- D. It tracks the maximum lag between the followers and the last applied record in the metadata partition

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka.controller:type=QuorumController,name=MaxFollowerLag` metric plays a crucial role in monitoring the health and synchronization of the KRaft controllers. It indicates the maximum lag between the active controller and the followers in terms of metadata records.

The active controller is responsible for appending new records to the metadata partition and advancing the high watermark. The followers continuously replicate these records from the active controller to stay in sync with the latest metadata changes.

The `MaxFollowerLag` metric measures the maximum lag, in terms of the number of records, between the active controller's log end offset (LEO) and the followers' LEO. In other words, it represents how far behind the slowest follower is compared to the active controller.

Monitoring the `MaxFollowerLag` metric is essential to ensure that the followers are keeping up with the active controller and are not falling behind in replicating the metadata records. A high value of `MaxFollowerLag` indicates that one or more followers are lagging significantly, which can impact the overall consistency and reliability of the KRaft cluster.

A is incorrect because the metric measures the lag between the active controller and the followers, not the lag between the active controller and the last committed record.

C is incorrect because the metric represents the actual lag in terms of the number of records, not the maximum allowed lag.

D is incorrect because the metric measures the lag between the active controller and the followers, not the lag between the followers and the last applied record.

## Question 16
What is the significance of the `kafka.server:type=SnapshotEmitter,name=LatestSnapshotGeneratedAgeMs` metric in KRaft mode?

- A. It indicates the age of the latest snapshot in milliseconds since the snapshot was generated
- B. It measures the time taken to generate the latest snapshot in milliseconds
- C. It represents the age of the latest snapshot in milliseconds since the process was started
- D. It tracks the time elapsed since the latest snapshot was loaded in milliseconds

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka.server:type=SnapshotEmitter,name=LatestSnapshotGeneratedAgeMs` metric holds significance as it indicates the age of the latest snapshot in milliseconds since the snapshot was generated.

Snapshots play a vital role in the KRaft consensus protocol. They are used to capture the state of the metadata log at a particular point in time and provide a compact representation of the metadata. Snapshots help in reducing the size of the metadata log and enable faster recovery of the controllers during startup or failover.

The `LatestSnapshotGeneratedAgeMs` metric provides information about how long ago the latest snapshot was generated. It measures the time elapsed since the snapshot was created, expressed in milliseconds.

Monitoring the `LatestSnapshotGeneratedAgeMs` metric is important for understanding the freshness of the snapshots and ensuring that snapshots are being generated regularly. A high value of this metric indicates that the latest snapshot is relatively old, and it may be beneficial to trigger a new snapshot generation to capture the latest state of the metadata log.

B is incorrect because the metric measures the age of the latest snapshot, not the time taken to generate it.

C is incorrect because the metric represents the age of the snapshot since it was generated, not since the process was started.

D is incorrect because the metric tracks the age of the generated snapshot, not the time elapsed since the snapshot was loaded.

## Question 17
What is the purpose of the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=ControlledShutdownCount` metric in KRaft mode?

- A. It measures the number of controlled shutdown requests received by the controller
- B. It indicates the number of brokers that have completed a controlled shutdown
- C. It represents the number of brokers that are currently in the process of controlled shutdown
- D. It tracks the number of controlled shutdown failures experienced by the controller

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=ControlledShutdownCount` metric serves the purpose of indicating the number of brokers that have completed a controlled shutdown.

Controlled shutdown is a process in which a broker gracefully shuts down after transferring its partitions to other brokers in the cluster. It ensures that the broker's responsibilities are properly handed over and helps in maintaining the overall stability and availability of the Kafka cluster.

The `ControlledShutdownCount` metric keeps track of the number of brokers that have successfully completed the controlled shutdown process. When a broker initiates a controlled shutdown, it communicates with the controller to coordinate the transfer of its partitions. Once the controller confirms that all the partitions have been safely transferred and the broker can be shut down, it increments the `ControlledShutdownCount` metric.

Monitoring the `ControlledShutdownCount` metric provides insights into the number of brokers that have undergone a controlled shutdown. It can be useful for tracking the progress of rolling restarts or planned maintenance activities in the cluster.

A is incorrect because the metric does not measure the number of controlled shutdown requests received by the controller. It focuses on the number of completed shutdowns.

C is incorrect because the metric represents the number of brokers that have completed the controlled shutdown, not the number of brokers currently in the process of shutting down.

D is incorrect because the metric tracks the count of successful controlled shutdowns, not the number of controlled shutdown failures.

## Question 18
What is the significance of the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=GlobalTopicCount` metric in KRaft mode?

- A. It represents the total number of topics in the Kafka cluster
- B. It indicates the number of global topics that are not associated with any specific cluster
- C. It measures the number of topics that have global replication enabled
- D. It tracks the count of topics that are globally accessible across all Kafka clusters

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=GlobalTopicCount` metric holds significance as it represents the total number of topics in the Kafka cluster.

The Kafka controller is responsible for managing the topic metadata and maintaining a consistent view of the topics across the cluster. The `GlobalTopicCount` metric provides a count of all the topics that exist in the cluster, including both regular topics and internal topics.

Monitoring the `GlobalTopicCount` metric gives you an overview of the topic landscape in your Kafka cluster. It allows you to track the growth of topics over time and helps in capacity planning and resource allocation. An increasing trend in the `GlobalTopicCount` metric indicates that new topics are being created, while a decreasing trend suggests that topics are being deleted.

Additionally, the `GlobalTopicCount` metric can be useful for monitoring the overall health and performance of the Kafka cluster. A sudden spike in the topic count may indicate a misconfiguration or an unexpected behavior that requires investigation.

B is incorrect because the metric does not specifically indicate the number of global topics that are not associated with any cluster. It represents the total number of topics within a single Kafka cluster.

C is incorrect because the metric does not measure the number of topics with global replication enabled. Topic replication is configured on a per-topic basis and is not directly related to the `GlobalTopicCount` metric.

D is incorrect because the metric tracks the count of topics within a single Kafka cluster, not across all Kafka clusters. Topics are typically specific to a particular cluster and are not globally accessible across different clusters.

## Question 19
What is the purpose of the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=TopicDeletionCount` metric in KRaft mode?

- A. It measures the number of topics that have been marked for deletion
- B. It indicates the number of topics that have been successfully deleted
- C. It represents the count of failed topic deletion attempts
- D. It tracks the number of topics that are currently in the process of being deleted

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In KRaft mode, the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=TopicDeletionCount` metric serves the purpose of indicating the number of topics that have been successfully deleted.

Topic deletion is an administrative operation that removes a topic and all its associated data from the Kafka cluster. When a topic is marked for deletion, the Kafka controller coordinates the deletion process across all the brokers that hold partitions for that topic.

The `TopicDeletionCount` metric keeps track of the number of topics that have been successfully deleted by the controller. Each time a topic is completely removed from the cluster, the `TopicDeletionCount` metric is incremented.

Monitoring the `TopicDeletionCount` metric provides insights into the topic deletion activity in your Kafka cluster. It allows you to track the number of topics that have been deleted over time and can be useful for auditing and governance purposes.

An increasing trend in the `TopicDeletionCount` metric indicates that topics are being actively deleted, while a flat or zero value suggests that no topic deletions have occurred recently.

A is incorrect because the metric does not measure the number of topics marked for deletion. It specifically tracks the count of successfully deleted topics.

C is incorrect because the metric represents the count of successful topic deletions, not failed deletion attempts.

D is incorrect because the metric tracks the number of topics that have been successfully deleted, not the topics currently in the process of being deleted.

</details>

## Question 20
What is the significance of the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=TopicChangeRate` metric in KRaft mode?

- A. It measures the rate at which new topics are being created in the Kafka cluster
- B. It indicates the rate at which existing topics are being modified or updated
- C. It represents the rate at which topics are being deleted from the Kafka cluster
- D. It tracks the overall rate of topic-related changes, including creation, modification
